PROJECT SUMMARY
The various extracurricular that college has to offer are an integral part of college
life. However, given the wide variety of extracurricular and the innumerable
competitions existing, it becomes a hassle for a student to register for various
events since there is no common portal for all registrations to take place under
one roof. Often deadlines to register are missed and students are left dejected.
We decided to solve this problem by integrating a common registration portal in
the form of a mobile application.
Product description: A common portal for various competitions and tournaments
across various categories (debate, dramatics, sports, technical etc). It serves as an
overarching platform to register for events across various categories. Students
can search for events across categories, and seamlessly register for them, while
saving time.
Till now, the only sources of notifying about such events were WhatsApp and
Facebook spamming. Needless to say, this cluttered approach did not help as
messages were often lost in group conversations. Now, students can simply go on
to our application, search for events by category, and register for them. It is a one
stop solution with a simple and attractive UI.
The application requires a front end where users will register for events,
databases that stores the information of both the users as well as the
competitions, networking for making calls between app and database; all this
integrated in an Android mobile application. Weâ€™ve used Firebase for the
database management and Android studio for the mobile app development.
